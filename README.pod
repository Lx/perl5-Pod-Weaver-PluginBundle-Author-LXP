=head1 NAME

Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Author::LXP - configure Pod::Weaver like LXP

=head1 VERSION

This module is part of distribution Pod-Weaver-PluginBundle-Author-LXP v1.0.0.

This distribution's version numbering follows the conventions defined at L<semver.org|http://semver.org/>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

In F<weaver.ini>:

    [@Author::LXP]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<Pod::Weaver> plugin bundle configures Pod::Weaver the way CPAN
author C<LXP> uses it, achieving the same result as these entries in a
F<weaver.ini> file:

    ;; SETUP ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

    ; "A bundle for the most commonly-needed prep work for a POD
    ; document."  Not sure what it actually does, but it's probably
    ; important.
    [@CorePrep]

    ; "Stopwords" are words that a spell checker might otherwise flag
    ; as misspelt.  This plugin adds some words based on the
    ; distribution's content and gathers explicitly defined ones at the
    ; top so that they are also honoured.
    [-StopWords]

    ; Provide a "list" POD formatter for easier definition of lists.
    [-Transformer]
    transformer = List
